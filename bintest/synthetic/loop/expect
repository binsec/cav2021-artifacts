in this test we check that simplifications help unroll trivial loops

CHECK: [sse:result] Model
CHECK: input_{{.}} : {0x00000008; 32}
CHECK: [sse:info] SMT queries
no need to prove that going further in the loop is ok
CHECK:              sat            2
no need to prove that we don't go out of the loop
CHECK:              unsat          0
CHECK:              unknown        0
CHECK:              total          2
