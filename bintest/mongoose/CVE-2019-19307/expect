CHECK: [sse:result] Model
CHECK: input_{{[0-9]*}} : {0x{{..........fffffffa..}}; 80}

The output found (..fffffffa.. little-endian) really looks like the one given
in the issue (\x00\xfa\xff\xff\xff\x7f big endian). To be honest, as the cve
involves complex overflows, I don't really know what the right outputs are.
The first byte is supposed not to be important (a type of message, when we only
care about the length) and no idea about the next bytes. I imagine they depend
on the type of packet.
